* Comparative Analysis of A* & Dijkstra *
*
* Implements and compares the performance of Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for route finding, incorporating weighted and unweighted edges. It evaluates travel distance, time, and average speed, demonstrating that A* maintains consistent efficiency across different scenarios, often outperforming Dijkstra's algorithm, particularly in weighted contexts.
