# Comparative Analysis of A* & Dijkstra Algorithms

* Implements and compares the performance of Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for route finding, incorporating its original version with distance as the inherant cost and adding prioritization for distance vs. time. It evaluates travel distance, time, and average speed, demonstrating that A* maintains consistent efficiency across different scenarios, often outperforming Dijkstra's algorithm.
